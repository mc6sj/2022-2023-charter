# 2022-2023 Praxis Cohort Charter

### Preamble or Intro

### Cohort Culture
* Have lunch together every Wednesday after Code Lab.
* For group tasks, always discuss what structure would best suit our abilities and schedules. Never assume.
* Be aware of your colleagues. Don't wait for them to share discomfort or any kind of difficulties. Reach out and offer your help regularly.
* Don't let problems bottle up. It's better to nip issues in the bud. Similarly, you're likely to spend less time stuck on a particular task if you ask for help.
* Have social events to celebrate milestones. It's important to pause and have fun.
* Following Katherine McKittrick's interdisciplinary anticolonial methodology, cultivate a spirit of curiousity and wonder as we tackle our tasks collectively and individually. In Dear Science she reminds us, "The method is rigorous too. Wonder is study. Curiousity is attentive" (5).


### Accountability 
* Break your goal into itemizable tasks that you can assign other people.
* Have weekly check-ins through Slack regardless of whether you we were able to complete your tasks or not. It's important to know what is truly achievable!
* It's okay to backtrack, don't feel bad about it. Just be sure to constantly share your process with your colleagues. 
* Eveything is negotiable except communication. If all fails, good communication will be the key to get back on track.
