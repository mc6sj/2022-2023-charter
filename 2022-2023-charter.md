# 2022-2023 Praxis Cohort Charter

### Preamble or Intro

### Cohort Culture
* Have lunch together every Wednesday after Code Lab.
* For group tasks, always discuss what structure would best suit our abilities and schedules. Never assume.
* Be aware of your colleagues. Don't wait for them to share discomfort or any kind of difficulties. Reach out and offer your help regularly.
* Don't let problems bottle up. It's better to nip issues in the bud. Similarly, you're likely to spend less time stuck on a particular task if you ask for help.
* Have social events to celebrate milestones. It's important to pause and have fun.


### Accountability 
* Break your goal into itemizable tasks that you can assign other people.
* Have weekly check-ins through Slack regardless of whether you we were able to complete your tasks or not. It's important to know what is truly achievable!
* It's okay to backtrack, don't feel bad about it. Just be sure to constantly share your process with your colleagues. 
* Eveything is negotiable except communication. If all fails, good communication will be the key to get back on track.
